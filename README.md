# E-hospitals
Through this integrated system, healthcare professionals can access real-time patient data, make informed decisions, and provide personalized treatment plans. Patients benefit from improved communication channels, online appointment booking, and easy access to their medical history. Administrative tasks such as billing, inventory management, and resource allocation become more efficient, contributing to overall operational excellence.

It is very important to maintain efficient software to handle information of a Hospital. In this busy world we don't have the time to wait in infamously long hospital queues. We are going to  create Smart Hospitals to enhance community healthcare. Through this project, we aim to streamline patient management, appointments, and medical records, improving overall efficiency. By developing a user-friendly interface, we seek to empower both medical staff and patients, fostering better communication and engagement. Additionally, we aspire to contribute to the community by providing a technologically advanced healthcare solution that promotes well-being and access to quality medical services.

Database Schema: Create tables for patient records, including demographics, medical history, and current treatments. Algorithm: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for patient data. 

Appointment Scheduling:
Database Schema: Design tables for appointments, linking them to patients and doctors. 
Algorithm: Develop a scheduling algorithm that considers doctor availability, patient preferences, and priority.

 Medication Management: 
Database Schema: Create tables for medications, prescriptions, and dosage instructions. 
Algorithm: Implement a system to track medication dispensing, refills, and interactions.

 Medical Device Integration: 
Database Schema: Set up tables for data from IoT medical devices like heart rate monitors or glucose meters. Algorithm: Create a data ingestion pipeline to process and store device data, triggering alerts for abnormal readings.

Patient Monitoring:
 Database Schema: Build tables for real-time patient monitoring data, such as vitals.
 Algorithm: Implement algorithms to detect anomalies and send alerts when vital signs deviate from normal ranges.
